Where applicable, please follow these guidelines to create a clean, SEO friendly website that adheres to Blenderbox's best practices.\r\n\r\n## 1.0    - HTML\r\n\r\n*    Use the default package for directory structure and the base styles.\r\n*    Do not use in-line JavaScript and never use in-line CSS.\r\n*    Keep scripts at the bottom of the page and CSS links in the head of the page to help with page load performance.\r\n*    Do not use tables when you can avoid it, and most likely, you can avoid it.\r\n*    Make sure all images have an alt attribute.\r\n\r\n## 2.0    - CSS\r\n\r\n*    Do not make the CSS overly complicated, but rather let the styles cascade where reasonable and applicable while using as little mark up as necessary.\r\n*    When starting a project, begin by styling the basic HTML elements.  If no design is provided for that, please confirm that it is not needed.\r\n*    Make sure all links and buttons have a rollover state.  If you cannot find a rollover or on state in a PSD, please contact project management and let them know and they will provide you with one.\r\n*    Don't use ID's #hotdrama - Id selectors have priority over other kinds of selectors. This can make it harder to add new rules using less specific selectors, leading to specificity wars: http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html\r\n*    Be consistent with indentation\r\n*    Be consistent about where spaces before/after colons/braces go\r\n*    One selector per line, One rule per line\r\n*    Use lowercase and dashes for classes.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\n    .weather {\r\n      background: LightCyan;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .weather > h3 {\r\n      border-bottom: 1px solid white;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2.1  - CSS Preprocessor (Sass/Less) Style Guide\r\n\r\n*    List @extend(s) First - Knowing right off the bat that this class inherits another whole set of rules from elsewhere is good.\r\n*    List \"Regular\" Styles Next\r\n*    List @include(s) Next - This visually separates the @extends and @includes as well as groups the @includes for easier reading. You might also want to make the call on separating user-authored @includes and vendor-provided @includes.\r\n*    Nested Selectors Last\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    .weather {\r\n      @extends %module;\r\n      background: LightCyan;\r\n      @include transition(all 0.3s ease);\r\n\r\n      > h3 {\r\n        border-bottom: 1px solid white;\r\n        @include transform(rotate(90deg));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n*    All Vendor Prefixes Use @mixins\r\n*    Maximum Nesting: Three Levels Deep - Chances are, if you're deeper than that, you're writing a crappy selector. Crappy in that it's too reliant on HTML structure (fragile), overly specific (too powerful), and not very reusable (not useful). It's also on the edge of being difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    .weather {\r\n\r\n      .cities {\r\n\r\n        li {\r\n          // no more!\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n*    Partials are named _partial.scss - This is a common naming convention that indicates this file isn't meant to be compiled by itself. It likely has dependancies that would make it impossible to compile by itself. Personally I like dashes in the \"actual\" filename though, like _dropdown-menu.scss.\r\n*    Variablize All Common Numbers, and Numbers with Meaning\r\n*    Variablize All Colors\r\n\r\n## 3.0 JavaScript\r\n\r\nUse the module pattern\r\n\r\n\r\n    var APP = (function($, undefined) {\r\n        'use strict';\r\n    \r\n        var app = {},\r\n            $el;\r\n    \r\n        // define public functions\r\n        app.foo = function() {  };\r\n    \r\n        // define private functions\r\n        function init() {\r\n            // Init the plugin\r\n        }\r\n        // Call the init function on load\r\n        $(init);\r\n        return app;\r\n    } (jQuery));\r\n \r\n\r\nOnly use one var declaration and put each variable on its own line\r\n\r\n\r\n    var a,\r\n        b,\r\n        z;\r\n\r\n\r\nUse the exactly equal to (equal value and equal type) instead of ==\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n        1 === '1'\r\n\r\nDon't leave extra spaces.\r\n\r\nValidate your JavaScript with a linter such as http://www.jshint.com/ which can be installed as a plugin in most editors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3.0 - TIPS TO FOLLOW\r\n\r\nSome of the common issues with browser compliance as well as the Blenderbox standards can be found below.\r\n\r\n*    Use the line-height attribute when vertically aligning a single line of text or input field.  This is often helpful when styling footers etc.\r\n*    Write the CSS with a hierarchical approach.  For instance, if the header element appears on the top of the page, put the header element at the top of the CSS file.\r\n*    All label tags attributes should be set to the value of the input field id so a user can click the label to select the field.  All fields should have a label if there is design for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEARING\r\n\r\nWe have two options for clearing, first the clearfix class and second the clear class.  You can read more about the clearfix here http://www.webtoolkit.info/css-clearfix.html The basic clearing class, .clearfix, uses the ‘:after’ pseudo-selector to add clearing after the tag you are floating.  To clear after a floated element, you can use clearfix.  \r\n\r\nExamples of clearing after:\r\n\r\n    <div class=”clearfix”>\r\n      <div class=\"float-left\">\r\n        Content that is floating\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you need to use a block element to clear a float, please use a div with a non-breaking space.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n    <div class=”float-left-class”></div>\r\n    <div class=”clear”>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTONS\r\n\r\nUse the button tag because it can be more reliably styled in every browser\r\n\r\n    <button type=\"submit\"></button>\r\n\r\n\r\nIMAGES\r\n\r\n*    Cut out as much white-space from an image as you can.\r\n*    Save .png files instead of .gif files when you can.\r\n*    Save .gif files when there are few colors or the image is a vector to optimize for performance and quality.\r\n*    Save .jpg files at 'High' in the Save for Web settings when using Photoshop.\r\n*    All images should have alt tags describing the image.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4.0 - Template Delivery\r\n\r\n*    Please make sure the CSS and HTML on all pages validates.  You can use the HTML5 validator to address any issues http://html5.validator.nu/\r\n*    Test the files in IE8+, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 5.0 - The default file directory\r\n\r\n    /fonts\r\n\r\n    /images\r\n\r\n    /javascripts\r\n        /app - All page specific Javascripts go here.\r\n            application.js - All application wide JavaScript goes here.  This is where you start the JavaScript development.\r\n\r\n        /libs – A folder with libraries written by someone else. jQuery, belatedpng, modernizer, should be here.\r\n            If you add new libraries, place them here.\r\n            jquery-{version}.min.js – the jQuery library.\r\n            log.js - Add logging support to browsers without console.log\r\n            modernizr-{version}.min.js – A JavaScript library for HTML5 tests. http://www.modernizr.com/ This should be included in the Head of your page to add HTML5 elements to IE.  Review the file to see what tests are available and visit the website if you need to add more tests.\r\n            request_interval.js - a shim for request animation support.\r\n\r\n        simple-plugin-template.jquery.js – A simpler jQuery plugin template.\r\n\r\n    /stylesheets\r\n        all.css\r\n\r\n    index.html – A basic file for starting the site with most relevant HTML elements for style.\r\n    humans.txt – Read more: http://goo.gl/IjffW\r\n    robots.txt – Read more: http://goo.gl/JzIqS\r\n\r\n## 6.0 - IE Targeted Styles\r\n\r\nIf you want to style for IE specifically, use the following classes that are added to the HTML node via conditional statements and Modernizr.\r\n\r\nIE7 - lt-ie8\r\nIE8 - lt-ie9\r\n\r\n    .lt-ie8 body { background:lime; }\r\n    .lt-ie9 body { background:pink; }\r\n\r\n\r\nTo target browsers that do not have JavaScript support, use the no-js class.\r\n\r\n    .no-js body { background:light-blue; }\r\n\r\n## 7.0 Icons\r\n\r\nWe use icon fonts for our icons.  To generate them, use [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/) Select the icons you want or upload SVGs of the icons you need and the select download.  On the download screen, change the font name to 'icons', check 'encode and embed font in css,' and select 'use class selector.' Then download the font and store the zip in your project in case someone needs to make changes to it later by uploading the selection.json file to icomoon.\r\n\r\nGenerate all the icons you need for every devise here [realfavicongenerator.net](http://realfavicongenerator.net/)\r\n\r\n## 8.0 Compiling\r\n\r\nWe are compiling the SASS into one file with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)).  We assume you have npm installed.\r\n\r\nInstall grunt client with\r\n\r\n    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAssuming that the Grunt CLI has been installed, it's very easy to start working with Grunt:\r\n\r\nChange to the project's root directory.\r\n\r\nInstall project dependencies with\r\n\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\nRun Grunt with\r\n\r\n    grunt\r\n\r\nThat's really all there is to it. Installed Grunt tasks can be listed by running grunt --help.\r\n","google":"UA-592025-23","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
